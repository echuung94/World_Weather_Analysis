# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this assignment was to add a weather description to the PlanMyTrip app. With the weather data was already retrieved while working throughout the module, we were to use inputs statements and Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four cities as well as as a marker layer map.</br></br>
Initially, a set a 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes were generated. The nearest city was then retrieved and an API call was performed with the OpenWeaterMap. We were also required to retrieve the current weather description for each city. After a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data was created, we used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences. The preferences were then used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The destinations and hotels were shown on a marker layer map with pop-up markers. We used the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary to show the route between the four cities that were chosen for possible travel destinations. Finally, a marker layer map with a pop-up marker was created for each city on the itinerary.
